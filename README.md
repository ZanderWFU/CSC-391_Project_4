# CSC-391_Project_4
Object Detection Part 2

slicer.py the program I used to generate test images, it will divide up an image (specified with target_name in the code) into 200x200 patches, and then prompt the user on whether the image features a palm tree or not, press 'A' for Palm, 'S' for skip, 'D' Not Palm. The program will automatically name each image and put it in the correct folder for later use.
